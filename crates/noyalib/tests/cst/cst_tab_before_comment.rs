//! A tab before a comment is separation, not indentation (#428).
//!
//! YAML 1.2.2 gives `l-comment ::= s-separate-in-line c-nb-comment-text?
//! b-comment` with `s-white ::= s-space | s-tab` (§6.2, §6.6). The
//! no-tabs rule is about *indentation* (§6.1), and a comment line has no
//! indentation to satisfy — so a tab in front of `#` is as legal as a
//! space.
//!
//! The bug was that the answer depended on the quote style of the line
//! above: the two paths leave the scanner at different `indent` values,
//! and the top-level escape in `reject_tab_indentation` is keyed on
//! that.

/// The same spec argument arguably reaches here too: the line is less
