# scripts/msrv-per-crate.sh — verify each workspace crate
# compiles cleanly against its declared `rust-version`.
#
# A workspace-wide `cargo +<msrv> check` only enforces the floor
# of the crate at the workspace root. With satellite crates that
# can declare higher floors (e.g. `noyalib-lsp` may need a newer
# rustc than the core lib), the workspace check leaves drift
# undetected — a satellite crate adopting a 1.85-only feature
# wouldn't break the gate until a downstream user pinned to 1.75.
#
# This script walks each `crates/*/Cargo.toml`, reads its
# `rust-version` field, installs that toolchain on demand, and
# runs `cargo +<msrv> check --manifest-path …` against the
# crate. Fails on the first mismatch.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/msrv-per-crate.sh                 # check every crate
#   ./scripts/msrv-per-crate.sh noyalib-lsp     # check just one
#
# Run from the workspace root.
