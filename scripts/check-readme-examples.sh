# Compile every ```rust code block in the workspace-root README.md
# against `noyalib` from a throwaway scratch project.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# The GitHub landing-page README (`./README.md`) is not the same
# file as the crate-level README (`crates/noyalib/README.md`).
# Only the latter is picked up by
# `#[doc = include_str!("../README.md")]` in `lib.rs`, because the
# workspace-root README lives outside the crate's package layout
# and referencing it via `include_str!` would break
# `cargo publish --dry-run` verification.
#
# This script closes that hole. It:
#   1. extracts every ```rust code block from the workspace-root
#      README (excluding blocks tagged `,ignore` — the doctest
#      escape hatch, same semantics as rustdoc);
#   2. wraps each block with a `fn main()` if the block does not
#      already declare one (matches rustdoc's implicit-main
#      behaviour);
#   3. compiles the block against a scratch cargo project that
#      depends on `path = "../.."` of noyalib with `--all-features`
#      so schema / validate-schema / policy / etc. examples all
#      resolve;
#   4. surfaces any compile error with a precise block-index +
#      README-line reference.
#
# Run locally:
#   bash scripts/check-readme-examples.sh
#
# CI wiring: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs this after the main
# test job so a broken root-README example fails a PR.
