# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds the architectural decisions that shape
noyalib — the choices that would be expensive to reverse and
that contributors should understand before proposing structural
changes.

## Format

Every ADR uses [Michael Nygard's format](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/tree/main/locales/en/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard)
— see [`TEMPLATE.md`](./TEMPLATE.md). Sections are:

- **Status:** proposed / accepted / superseded / deprecated
- **Context:** what forces are at play
- **Decision:** what we're doing
- **Consequences:** what becomes easier and harder

ADRs are **immutable** once accepted — if a decision changes, the
old ADR moves to "superseded" and a new ADR is added with a
reference back. Nothing is silently rewritten.

## When to add an ADR

Add one when you're about to make a decision that:

- Is hard to reverse (changes the data model, public API surface,
  dependency floor, or core invariants like the unsafe policy)
- Will surprise a future contributor reading the code
- Has plausible alternatives that someone might propose later

Don't add ADRs for routine implementation choices — those go in
commit messages and code comments. The bar is "would I want a
new contributor to read this before proposing the opposite?"

## When *not* to add an ADR

- The decision is captured by the type system or a test
- The decision is implicit in well-known Rust idiom
- The decision is genuinely reversible without consequence
