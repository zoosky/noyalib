/// `Document` carries three coordinated views of the same input:
/// an immutable green tree that reproduces the source byte-for-byte,
/// a typed [`Value`] for data access, and an internal span tree
/// that maps any [`Value`]-shaped path back to a byte range. Edits
/// flow through [`Document::replace_span`] (the primitive) and
/// [`Document::set`] (the path-shaped wrapper); untouched bytes —
/// indentation, comments, blank lines, sibling entries — are

///
/// Every path-taking method reads the grammar described in
/// [`crate::path`]: `server.port`, `items[0].name`, and, for a key the
/// grammar would otherwise read as structure, a bracket-quoted segment
/// such as `labels["app.kubernetes.io/name"]`.

///

/// assert_eq!(doc.to_string(), src);

    ///   the *parent* key, so `rename_key` refuses it outright. A key
    ///   the grammar would misread is addressed as `servers["web"]`.
    /// - `new_key` is `<<`: the loader treats a `<<` key as a merge
    ///   directive whatever its quote style, so the rename cannot
    ///   round-trip.
    /// - `new_key` contains a non-printable character (any control
    ///   character other than tab, `U+007F`, or a `U+0080..=U+009F`
    ///   C1 control) — YAML's printable set excludes them and no
    ///   scalar style can spell them here.
    /// - Restrictions above.
    /// - The containing mapping already has a *different* entry
    ///   whose key equals `new_key` — the rename would create a
    ///   duplicate and silently change data. Reported separately
    ///   when that sibling comes from a `<<` merge rather than from

    /// - The addressed key has no entry of its own because a `<<`
    ///   merge key produced it — the key lives in the merged
    ///   mapping, so that is where it must be renamed.
    /// - The path is reached *through* an alias (`*name`): the
    ///   bytes at that site belong to the anchor, so the anchor's
    ///   own entry must be renamed instead.
